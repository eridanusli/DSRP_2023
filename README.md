# DSRP_2023 Labwork for Penguin Dataset
This is independent work from the DSRP Summer 2023 program. It uses a dataset on penguins to explore introductory data visualization, plotting, and data processing.

### Folder Descriptions
- *Labs:* Labwork that explores data visualization and simple data processing
- *Data:* The .cvs file that was used for the labs
- *Plots:* Images of the plots generated in the Data Visualization lab. Explores different kinds of plot types.
- *Notes:* Covers the basics of R and data processing

### About the Dataset

The dataset indentifies the size, clutch, blood isotope, and other relevant biological details for adult penguins in Palmer station. It identifies these characteristics of 344 adelie, gentoo, and chinstrap penguins:

- *Geographical:* Region, island
- *Biological:* Stage, sex, culmen length & depth, flipper length, body mass, delta 15 n, delta 13 c
- *Other:* Individual ID, clutch completion, date of egg study, additional comments
